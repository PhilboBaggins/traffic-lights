# Assembly instructions for single traffic light

TODO: Assembly instructions here






If using a version 1.0 PCB, place a plastic washer between the PCB and the screw head / nut to stop the screw/nut making contact with the PCB (see [issue #2 on Github for more details](https://github.com/PhilboBaggins/traffic-lights/issues/2)).
